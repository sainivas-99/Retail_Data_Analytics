#Retail Sales Data Analysis Project

##Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of retail sales data to derive meaningful insights and develop a predictive model for forecasting weekly sales.

##Project Components
Data Collection: Gathered and compiled retail sales data from diverse sources.
Data Preprocessing: Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing using R, addressing challenges such as missing data and handling categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employed R for in-depth exploratory data analysis, uncovering patterns and trends within the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Applied advanced feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
Machine Learning Model Development: Utilized R to develop a predictive model for forecasting weekly sales.

##Technologies Used
R: Leveraged R's statistical capabilities for data analysis and machine learning.
RStudio: The project was developed using RStudio, providing an integrated development environment for R.

##Results
The project successfully delivered a predictive model capable of forecasting weekly sales. I have utilized various statistical techniques and machine learning methodologies to overcome challenges presented by the dataset. Findings were communicated through insightful visualizations, contributing to data-driven decision-making.
